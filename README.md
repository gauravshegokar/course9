# course project

We analyse mtcars dataset, see the correlation between mpg and different features in the dataset. Then we build the model with features having high correlation and lowest p-value with mpg.

## Flow

- user can select number of observation to include
- user can plot different features aginst mpg and see the correlation between them
- user can select features on which he can build prediction model
